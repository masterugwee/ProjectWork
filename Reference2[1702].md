### Preventing Hospital Acquired Infections Through a Workflow-Based Cyber-Physical System

#### Summary

The paper is published by a three member team in Romania. The Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI) is a serious world wide problem leading to increased mortality rates.European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, approximately 4.2 million HAI occurred in 2013 alone in European long-term care facilities.
There exist clear preventive guidelines, but the application of these are poor.This paper details the software perspective for an innovative, business process software based cyber-physical system that will be implemented as part of a European Union funded research project.

The team presents an IoT-based solution. Integrating a network of sensors
that monitor clinical work-flows and ambient conditions with monitoring software, the system will provide real-time information and alerts. The system will monitor general processes known to affect HAI spread such as cleaning and equipment maintenance,
together with clinical processes at risk for HAI such as catheter insertion, postoperative care or mechanical ventilation.

##### Techniques
###### Hand hygiene :-
The clinician should perform
the hand disinfection procedure before going near a
patient and before leaving their surrounding. Example, this is achieved using the sink or the bathroom sink and the disinfectant dispenser. All of them
have inexpensive sensors together with RFID tags and bluetooth Low Energy transceivers; their role is to provide input to the workflow engine. The workflow
engine records received data into the persistent repository.

This paper is centered on technology driven preventive measures for a serious public health issue, namely hospital acquired infections. While most transmission routes are well understood and standard guidelines exist to curb them, available research
shows that in practice, they are either not applied or not applied thoroughly. As such, the team propose an innovative technological solution for preventing HAI and outbreaks.
