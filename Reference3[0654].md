### Using Artificial Intelligence to Improve Hospital Inpatient Care

#### Summary

The author talks about the recent advances in Electronic Health Records(EHR). AI can  build predictive models from a large patient population. Clinical decision support system is an example. More recent advances in machine learning and
AI build predictive models and make real time inferences from a large patient population for purposes including alerts, stratifying risk and
predicting the length of stay. Several of these approaches focus on critical care.

##### Technique

###### Time series topic model
Decision trees and neural networks were
used to generate binary classifiers of the patient
state and determine when to issue an alarm. Suchi Saria and her colleagues  developed a physiological assessment score for preterm newborns, using time-series data captured from the newborn’s.and a hierarchical Bayesian model, the time series topic model. This approach lets healthcare providers accurately estimate the probability of an infant’s risk of such severe problems as infections and cardiopulmonary complications.

###### Support Vector Machine

The risk of infection by (Clostridium difficile) by extracting more than 10,000 variables for each day of each hospital admission, using a support vector machine (SVM) to produce a time series of daily risk scores and applying various approaches (including Hidden Markov Models and SVMs) for time series classification.
